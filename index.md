Hello!  

I am a Nagaraj-Noll-Otellini Graduate Fellow in the Department of Astronomy, University of California at Berkeley.
I am broadly interested in observational astronomy with current focus on supernova explosions and exoplanet orbits.
I graduated with a B.Sc. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018. 
I grew up in a little village on the eastern coast of India. 
In my free time, I play cricket and tennis, take photo-walks, and write stories.
