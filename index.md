Hello! I am Kishore Patra, a Nagaraj-Noll-Otellini Graduate Fellow working with [Alex Filippenko](https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/alex-filippenko/) 
and [Wenbin Lu](https://wenbinlu.github.io/) in the Department of Astronomy at University of California Berkeley. I am broadly interested in astrophysics with current focus on transient events including supernova explosions, tidal disruption events, X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions and fast radio bursts. I have a specialized expertise in the technique of measuring polarization as a function of light wavelength (spectropolarimetry).

Before coming to Berkeley, I graduated with a B.Sc. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018. At MIT, I worked with [Josh Winn](https://scholar.princeton.edu/jwinn/home) and [Nevin Weinberg](https://blog.uta.edu/weinbergnn/) on the search for orbital decay in exoplanets.

I grew up in a little village on the eastern coast of India before moving to the UK, and then to the US for higher education. I spend most weekends playing [cricket](https://cricclubs.com/NCCA/viewPlayer.do?playerId=1437947&clubId=1191#parentHorizontalTab1) across northern California. I like to try new hobbies - these days I'm into learning chess, reading about development economics, and exploring maps.
