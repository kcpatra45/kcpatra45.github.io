Hello! I am a Nagaraj-Noll-Otellini Graduate Fellow in the Department of Astronomy, University of California at Berkeley.
I am broadly interested in observational astronomy with current focus on supernova explosions, tidal disruption events and exoplanet orbits. I have a specialized expertise in the technique of measuring polarization as a function of light wavelength (spectropolarimetry).

Before coming to Berkeley, I graduated with a B.Sc. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018. 
I grew up in a little village on the eastern coast of India. In my free time, I play cricket and tennis, explore maps and write stories.
