Hello! I am Kishore Patra, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California Observatories, working with [Ryan Foley](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=foley). I am broadly interested in astrophysics with current focus on transient events---including tidal disruption events, X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions, and supernovae---and astronomical instrumentation. 

I completed my PhD in 2024 from the Department of Astronomy at University of California Berkeley working with [Alex Filippenko](https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/alex-filippenko/) and [Wenbin Lu](https://wenbinlu.github.io/). Prior to that, I graduated with a B.Sc. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018. At MIT, I worked with [Josh Winn](https://scholar.princeton.edu/jwinn/home) and [Nevin Weinberg](https://blog.uta.edu/weinbergnn/) on the search for orbital decay in exoplanets.

I grew up in a small [village](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gurapalli,+Odisha,+India/@19.635222,85.1417546,418m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x3a181b48bce3d58d:0x63a4a01fad728133!8m2!3d19.6187071!4d85.1142207!16s%2Fg%2F12hmp70sm?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) on the eastern coast of India, before moving to the UK on a scholarship and later to the US for higher education.  

I spend most weekends playing [cricket](https://cricclubs.com/NCCA/viewPlayer.do?playerId=1437947&clubId=1191#parentHorizontalTab1) across Northern California. I enjoy trying out new hobbies---these days I'm learning chess, reading about development economics, exploring interesting maps, and entertaining an easily bored toddler.
