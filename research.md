I am broadly interested in observational astronomy. I have authored papers on supernova explosions, tidal orbital decay of exoplanets, supernova cosmology, stellar evolution and galaxy clusters. Currently, I work on measuring polarized light from transient events like supernova explosions and tidal disruption events. In the past, my work led to the first detection of a hot Jupiter spiraling in to the host star due to tidal orbital decay. Below are some more details about my current and past work. 


### Spectropolarimetry (specpol)
Extragalatic supernovae (SNe) are spatially unresolvable, even with the best of ground-based interferometers. For example, the most powerful ground-based interferometer, the Event Horizon Telescope, can currently achieve a resolution of ‚àº 60 ùúáas. For comparison, the minimum resolution required to study the geometry of a nearby SN, for instance 3 Mpc away would be ‚àº 10 ùúáas. Fortunately, specpol, which measures polarization as a function of wavelength, provides a unique approach to the study of the SN explosion geometry and its structure. 

#In SN atmospheres, photons are scattered by free electrons (Thomson scattering). If the projected photosphere is circularly symmetric,
#a complete cancellation of the electric vectors results in zero net polarization. However, if the projected photosphere deviates from circular
#symmetry, incomplete cancellation of the electric vectors would lead to
#nonzero polarization across the spectrum. Additionally, any clumps
#of high-opacity absorbing material present above the photosphere
#along the observer‚Äôs line of sight may block parts of the underlying
#photosphere. Therefore, an incomplete cancellation of the electric vectors
#will occur across the corresponding spectral lines, further producing
#nonzero polarization at those line wavelengths.
