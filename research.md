I am broadly interested in observational astronomy. I have authored papers on supernova explosions, tidal orbital decay of exoplanets, supernova cosmology, stellar evolution and galaxy clusters. Currently, I work with [Alex Filippenko](https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/alex-filippenko/) on measuring polarized light from transient events like supernova explosions and tidal disruption events. In the past, my work led to the first detection of a hot Jupiter spiraling in to the host star due to tidal orbital decay. Below are some more details about my current and past work. 


## Spectropolarimetry (specpol)
Extragalatic supernovae (SNe) are spatially unresolvable, even with the best of ground-based interferometers. For example, the most powerful ground-based interferometer, the Event Horizon Telescope, can currently achieve a resolution of ‚àº 60 ùúáas. For comparison, the minimum resolution required to study the geometry of a nearby SN, for instance 3 Mpc away would be ‚àº 10 ùúáas. Fortunately, specpol, which measures polarization as a function of wavelength, provides a unique approach to the study of the SN explosion geometry and its structure.

Shown above are some examples of SN geometries and the type of polarization signal expected from them. If the sky-projected SN photosphere is circularly symmetric, electric vectors cancel out resulting in zero net polarization. On the other hand, if  the photosphere deviates from circular symmetry, the cancellation is imperfect leading to a nonzero polarization in the spectral continuum. If newly synthesized material block parts of the photosphere (for e.g. Si, Ca), incomplete cancellation of electric vectors manifests as a polarization signal (line polarization) at the specific wavelengths absorbed by the material. 

My current goals are to constrain the progenitor system(s) and explosion mechanism(s) that lead to Type Ia supernovae. Specpol studies have demonstrated that these explosions show remarkable sphericity of the ejecta. Si II and Ca II absorption lines are often highly polarized (~ 1%) in these SNe, indicating high asymmetry in the spatial distribution of intermediate-mass elements synthesized in SNe Ia. We hope that by studying specpol of enough SNe Ia, we may be able to differentiate between the various theoretical models for these explosions. The plot below shows the polarization signal of the high-velocity Type Ia SN 2019ein.

## Orbital decay of hot Jupiters

The orbits of many of the hot Jupiters are expected to be slowly shrinking owing to tidal interactions between the planet and its host star. A hot Jupiter completes one orbit around its host star in ~ 1 day, whereas the star spins on its axis on a timescale of a few tens of days. Consequently, the bulge lags slightly behind the orbiting planet tugging back on it, sapping angular momentum from the orbit and transferring it to the stellar spin. Below is an illustration of the lagging tidal bulge. Similar tidal effects are the reason why the moon is slowly inching away from the earth. In the earth-moon system, the direction of transfer of angular momentum is from the earth's spin to the moon's orbit, owing to the fact the moon's orbital frequency is much smaller than the earth's spin frequency.

The tidal bulge raised on the star by the planet has to travel around the star, encountering resistance from the stellar layers. The efficiency with which the tidal bulge dissipates orbital energy as heat is characterized by the tidal quality factor Q<sub>*</sub>. It has proven difficult to calculate the tidal quality factor from first principles, with predicted values spanning several orders of magnitude from 10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>9</sup>. 

My work as an undergrad at MIT led to the first direct detection of the decaying orbit of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b. By measuring mid-transit times of this planet and combining them with historical mid-transit times spanning over a decade, my team and I were able to show that this planet is slowly spiralling inward at a rate of ~30 ms/year. Initially, we were unsure whether the apparent decrease in orbital period was due to tidal effects or whether we had witnessed a portion of an apsidally precessing orbit.  A couple more years of monitoring has now unequivocally confirmed that WASP-12b is on a collision course with its host star and is expected to merge with its host star in ~ 3 Myr.

The goals are now to understand what factors affect the rate of tidal orbital decay. What is special about WASP-12b that it is undergoing orbital decay yet other similar hot Jupiters do not?
