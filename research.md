I am broadly interested in observational astronomy. I have authored papers on supernova explosions, tidal orbital decay of exoplanets, tidal disruption events, supernova cosmology, stellar evolution and galaxy clusters. Currently, I work on measuring polarized light from transient events like supernova explosions and tidal disruption events. In the past, my work led to the first detection of a hot Jupiter spiraling in to the host star due to tidal orbital decay. Below are some more details about my current and past work. 


### Spectropolarimetry


### Orbital decay of hot Jupiters

#My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

#- I rock a great mustache
#- I'm extremely loyal to my family

#What else do you need? 
### My story

#To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
