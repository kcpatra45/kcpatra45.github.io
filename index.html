Hello! 
I am a graduate student working with Alex Filippenko on supernova explosions. My current research includes detecting polarized light from supernovae to determine the geometry of the explosion and its surroundings. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018. At MIT, I worked with Josh Winn and Nevin Weinberg on the search for orbital decay in exoplanets. 
I grew up in a little village on the eastern coast of India before moving to the UK in 2011, and then to the US in 2014. In my free time, I like playing cricket, taking photo-walks, writing and exploring the world on Google Earth.  


My academic journey has been possible only because of direct and indirect support from various individuals and organizations. I am very thankful to them:
-The tax payers of India for supporting my middle to early high school education at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Patiala 
-The Pestalozzi International Foundation, UK and the numerous donors for supporting my International Baccalaureate Diploma studies in the United Kingdom
-Numerous donors and the Paul E. Gray Undergraduate Research Fund for supporting my undergraduate education and research at MIT
-The Carl and Betty Helmholz Gateway Fellowship at International House UC Berkeley
-Sunil Nagaraj, Landon Noll and the tax payers of the state of California for funding part of my graduate studies at UC Berkeley
